      <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Before Linus Tech Tips</h2><br>
      Sebastian was working as a product manager for the now defunct Canadian online computer store NCIX. He was asked by the
      company to be the host for its technology channel, which was created to help demonstrate products.
      His first video was a demonstration for a Sunbeam processor heatsink.
      Due to high costs and low viewership during the early days of the channel, Linus was instructed to create the Linus Tech Tips
      channel as a cheaper offshoot of the NCIX channel, to allow for lower production values without impacting the NCIX brand.
      <i style="font-weight: bold;">Linus Tech Tips was created on November 24, 2008.</i>
      During his time at the company, he worked as a full-time sales representative,
      high-end systems designer, product manager, and category manager.
